      description: `2022-08 - PRESENT | OTETSUZUKI
OTETSUZUKI is an application that digitizes an organization or municipality's physical (printed) forms. The organization or municipality can freely fill out the desired form, verify it using the MyNumberCard if they wish, and accept payments through the created form.

　　● I developed advanced form applications with Typescript
　　● Due to my background as a designer, I fulfilled design needs such as wireframes, logos, and web design when necessary.
　　● I implemented the front-end part of the listing, filtering, and email sending-receiving pages in the admin panel
　　● The form creation page is structured similarly to Google Forms and contains quite complex functionalities, which I managed to implement.
　　● I implemented the search engine (for incoming applications) in the admin panel
　　● I independently developed the notification page, payment page, help page,
administrator assignment pages, etc. in the admin panel and public side.
　　● Fix the bugs
　　● Implementation of the new feature

Some customers: Osaka City, Kanagawa City, Saison

LGMATE for public servants in collaboration with Shintomi Town in Miyazaki Prefecture, Waseda University and Shiftplus Inc.

　　● Design and coding of the simulation, groups, profile etc. pages
　　● Implementation of the new feature
　　● Fix the bugs


2022-02 - 2022-08 | LGTalk
LGTALK is an application that enables communication among all team members in municipalities.

　　● I developed a WYSIWYG editor from the plain text section (textarea) of the chat application. I did this independently without using any plugins.
　　● I fixed some UX/UI problems. For example, I solved some issues in the mobile view.

Some customers: Kumamoto City, Miyazaki City, and Okayama
